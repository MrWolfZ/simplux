# @simplux/react

This is the react extension package of **simplux**. Usually you would expect some kind of API documentation here. However, **simplux** has a different approach to documentation: [recipes](../../../..#recipes). They will show you how simplux can make life simple for you. In addition, due to our use of TypeScript, all API documentation you would want is contained in the code itself.
