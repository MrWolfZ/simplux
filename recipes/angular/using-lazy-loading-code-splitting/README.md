# Recipe: using lazy loaded routes/code splitting in Angular application

This recipe shows you how simple it is to use **simplux** with your lazy loaded routes and while using code splitting for your Angular application.

If you are new to using **simplux** with Angular there is [a recipe](../using-in-angular-application#readme) that will help you get started before you follow this recipe.

> You can play with the code for this recipe in this [code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/MrWolfZ/simplux/tree/master/recipes/angular/using-lazy-loading-code-splitting).
