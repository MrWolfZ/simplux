This recipe shows you how simple it is to test your code that triggers side effects (like loading data from your API) with **simplux**.

If you are new to **simplux** there is [a recipe](../../basics/getting-started#readme) that will help you get started before you follow this recipe.

> You can play with the code for this recipe in this [code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/MrWolfZ/simplux/tree/master/recipes/advanced/testing-code-triggering-side-effects).

This recipe is still a work-in-progress.
