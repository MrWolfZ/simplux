# Recipe: debugging with Redux DevTools

This recipe shows you how simple it is to debug your state changes with **simplux** by leveraging the [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).

This recipe requires that you use an explicit Redux store. There is [a recipe](../using-in-redux-application#readme) that shows you how to do that, so we recommend you follow that recipe first.

> You can play with the code for this recipe in this [code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/MrWolfZ/simplux/tree/master/recipes/advanced/debugging-with-redux-devtools).

This recipe is still a work-in-progress.
