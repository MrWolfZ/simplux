# Recipe: using lazy loaded React components/code splitting

This recipe shows you how simple it is to use **simplux** with your lazy loaded React components and while using code splitting for your application.

If you are new to using **simplux** with React there is [a recipe](../using-in-react-application#readme) that will help you get started before you follow this recipe.

> You can play with the code for this recipe in this [code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/MrWolfZ/simplux/tree/master/recipes/react/using-lazy-loading-code-splitting).

This recipe is still a work-in-progress.
