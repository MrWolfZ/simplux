# Recipe: building non-trivial React applications

This recipe shows you how **simplux** helps you build non-trivial React applications that are well structured and maintainable.

If you are new to using **simplux** with React there is [a recipe](../using-in-react-application#readme) that will help you get started before you follow this recipe.

> You can play with the code for this recipe in this [code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/MrWolfZ/simplux/tree/master/recipes/react/building-non-trivial-applications).

This recipe is still a work-in-progress.
