# Recipe: testing my React components that trigger async work

This recipe shows you how simple it is to test your React components that trigger async work with **simplux**.

If you are new to using **simplux** with React there is [a recipe](../using-in-react-application#readme) that will help you get started before you follow this recipe.

> You can play with the code for this recipe in this [code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/MrWolfZ/simplux/tree/master/recipes/react/testing-components-using-async).

This recipe is still a work-in-progress.
