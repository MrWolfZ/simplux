# Recipe: using server-side rendering with my React application

This recipe shows you how simple it is to use **simplux** in your React application that uses server-side rendering (SSR).

If you are new to using **simplux** with React there is [a recipe](../using-in-react-application#readme) that will help you get started before you follow this recipe.

> You can play with the code for this recipe in this [code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/MrWolfZ/simplux/tree/master/recipes/react/using-server-side-rendering).

This recipe is still a work-in-progress.
