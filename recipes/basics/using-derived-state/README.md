# Recipe: using derived state

This is a recipe that shows how simple it is to compute derived state for a **simplux** module by using selectors.

If you are new to **simplux** we recommend you start with the recipe for [getting started](../getting-started#readme).

You can also see this recipe in action as a [code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/MrWolfZ/simplux/tree/master/recipes/basics/using-derived-state).
